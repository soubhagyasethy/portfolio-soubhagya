Hi! I'm Soubhagya!

Welcome to my portfolio.

This is a simple portfolio website using basic HTML and CSS. I have used various links from different websites to display photos and icons. At the end of the website (footer part) I have given links to my social media accounts. If you want to connect with me just click on the social media website icons, it will redirect you to that website. I have used the target attribute to the value of _blank, so that the link will open in a new window or tab.

Every day I'm learning things and keep updating my portfolio and adding new features to it.

For now, I know:

JavaScript

HTML5

CSS
